X,Y values of AOK will allow you to put frames fully off the screen, so you are able to cut off the image if you want
works with both negative values, and values greater than max resolution

Choords are pixels starting at 0,0 in the top left corner and going positive down and right.
jQuery should use this same sytem
If we have a system that has the user fullscreen the image to modify it would automatically be the right size for the monitor
otherwise we would need them to put in their resolution, and do some scaling math with the current size of the image/field, 
which would also have to be accounted for because it would change if people had their window windowed.


Y choord is inverted from jQuery, will need a smarter solution to have multiple resolutions supported, choord also starts at the bottom left instead of top left for images

There is about a 63 pixel x offset for the enemy frames (shift -63). This is probably for all resolutions unless ui gets scaled like that

TODO:
Two dropdowns, one for raw values of the json that can be modified
Other for selecting presets - should be populated from list of files inside Presets dir
